# ADR 019: Forced Inclusion Mechanism

## Changelog

- 2025-03-24: Initial draft
- 2025-04-23: Renumbered from ADR-018 to ADR-019 to maintain chronological order.
- 2025-11-10: Updated to reflect actual implementation
- 2026-02-23: Added sequencer catch-up mode documentation

## Context

In a single-sequencer rollup architecture, users depend entirely on the sequencer to include their transactions in blocks. This creates several problems:

1. **Censorship Risk**: A malicious or coerced sequencer can selectively exclude transactions
2. **Liveness Failure**: If the sequencer goes offline, no new transactions can be processed
3. **Centralization**: Users must trust a single entity to behave honestly
4. **No Recourse**: Users have no alternative path to submit transactions if the sequencer refuses them

While eventual solutions like decentralized sequencer networks exist, they introduce significant complexity. We need a simpler mechanism that provides censorship resistance and liveness guarantees while maintaining the performance benefits of a single sequencer.

## Alternative Approaches

### Decentralized Sequencer

A fully decentralized sequencer network would eliminate single points of failure but requires:

- Complex consensus mechanisms
- Increased latency due to coordination
- More infrastructure and operational complexity

### Automatic Sequencer Failover

Implementing automatic failover to backup sequencers when the primary goes down requires:

- Complex monitoring and health checks
- Coordination between sequencers to prevent forks
- Does not solve censorship issues with a malicious sequencer

## Decision

We implement a **forced inclusion mechanism** that allows users to submit transactions directly to the Data Availability (DA) layer. This approach provides:

1. **Censorship Resistance**: Users can always bypass the sequencer by posting to DA
2. **Verifiable Inclusion**: Full nodes verify that sequencers include all forced transactions
3. **Based Rollup Option**: A based sequencer mode for fully DA-driven transaction ordering
4. **Simplicity**: No complex timing mechanisms or fallback modes

### Key Components

1. **Forced Inclusion Namespace**: A dedicated DA namespace where users can post transactions
2. **DA Retriever**: Fetches forced inclusion transactions from DA using epoch-based scanning
3. **Single Sequencer**: Enhanced to include forced transactions from DA in every batch
4. **Based Sequencer**: Alternative sequencer that ONLY retrieves transactions from DA
5. **Verification**: Full nodes validate that blocks include all forced transactions

## Detailed Design

### User Requirements

Users can submit transactions in two ways:

1. **Normal Path**: Submit to sequencer's mempool/RPC (fast, low cost)
2. **Forced Inclusion Path**: Submit directly to DA forced inclusion namespace (censorship-resistant)

No additional requirements or monitoring needed from users.

### Systems Affected

1. **DA Layer**: New namespace for forced inclusion transactions
2. **Sequencer (Single)**: Fetches and includes forced transactions
3. **Sequencer (Based)**: New sequencer type that only uses DA transactions
4. **DA Retriever**: New component for fetching forced transactions
5. **Syncer**: Verifies forced transaction inclusion in blocks
6. **Configuration**: New fields for forced inclusion settings

### Data Structures

#### Forced Inclusion Event

```go
type ForcedIncludedEvent struct {
    Txs           [][]byte  // Forced inclusion transactions
    StartDaHeight uint64    // Start of DA height range
    EndDaHeight   uint64    // End of DA height range
}
```

#### DA Retriever Interface

```go
type DARetriever interface {
    // Retrieve forced inclusion transactions from DA at specified height
    RetrieveForcedIncludedTxsFromDA(ctx context.Context, daHeight uint64) (*ForcedIncludedEvent, error)
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

#### DA Retriever

The DA Retriever component handles fetching forced inclusion transactions:

```go
type daRetriever struct {
    da                         coreda.DA
    cache                      cache.CacheManager
    genesis                    genesis.Genesis
    logger                     zerolog.Logger
    namespaceForcedInclusionBz []byte
    hasForcedInclusionNs       bool
    daEpochSize                uint64
}

// RetrieveForcedIncludedTxsFromDA fetches forced inclusion transactions
// Only fetches at epoch boundaries to prevent redundant DA queries
func (r *daRetriever) RetrieveForcedIncludedTxsFromDA(
    ctx context.Context,
    daHeight uint64,
) (*ForcedIncludedEvent, error)
```

#### Single Sequencer Extension

The single sequencer is enhanced to fetch and include forced transactions:

```go
type Sequencer struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    fiRetriever               ForcedInclusionRetriever
    genesis                   genesis.Genesis
    daHeight                  atomic.Uint64
    pendingForcedInclusionTxs []pendingForcedInclusionTx
    queue                     *BatchQueue
}

type pendingForcedInclusionTx struct {
    Data           []byte
    OriginalHeight uint64
}

func (s *Sequencer) GetNextBatch(ctx context.Context, req GetNextBatchRequest) (*GetNextBatchResponse, error) {
    // 1. Fetch forced inclusion transactions from DA
    forcedEvent, err := s.fiRetriever.RetrieveForcedIncludedTxs(ctx, s.daHeight.Load())

    // 2. Process forced txs with size validation and pending queue
    forcedTxs := s.processForcedInclusionTxs(forcedEvent, req.MaxBytes)

    // 3. Get batch from mempool queue
    batch, err := s.queue.Next(ctx)

    // 4. Prepend forced txs and trim batch to fit MaxBytes
    if len(forcedTxs) > 0 {
        forcedTxsSize := calculateSize(forcedTxs)
        remainingBytes := req.MaxBytes - forcedTxsSize

        // Trim batch transactions to fit
        trimmedBatchTxs := trimToSize(batch.Transactions, remainingBytes)

        // Return excluded txs to front of queue
        if len(trimmedBatchTxs) < len(batch.Transactions) {
            excludedBatch := batch.Transactions[len(trimmedBatchTxs):]
            s.queue.Prepend(ctx, Batch{Transactions: excludedBatch})
        }

        batch.Transactions = append(forcedTxs, trimmedBatchTxs...)
    }

    return &GetNextBatchResponse{Batch: batch}
}

// processForcedInclusionTxs validates and queues forced txs
func (s *Sequencer) processForcedInclusionTxs(event *ForcedInclusionEvent, maxBytes uint64) [][]byte {
    var validatedTxs [][]byte
    var newPendingTxs []pendingForcedInclusionTx
    currentSize := 0

    // Process pending txs from previous epochs first
    for _, pendingTx := range s.pendingForcedInclusionTxs {
        if !ValidateBlobSize(pendingTx.Data) {
            continue // Skip blobs exceeding absolute DA limit
        }
        if WouldExceedCumulativeSize(currentSize, len(pendingTx.Data), maxBytes) {
            newPendingTxs = append(newPendingTxs, pendingTx)
            continue
        }
        validatedTxs = append(validatedTxs, pendingTx.Data)
        currentSize += len(pendingTx.Data)
    }

    // Process new txs from this epoch
    for _, tx := range event.Txs {
        if !ValidateBlobSize(tx) {
            continue // Skip blobs exceeding absolute DA limit
        }
        if WouldExceedCumulativeSize(currentSize, len(tx), maxBytes) {
            newPendingTxs = append(newPendingTxs, pendingForcedInclusionTx{
                Data:           tx,
                OriginalHeight: event.StartDaHeight,
            })
            continue
        }
        validatedTxs = append(validatedTxs, tx)
        currentSize += len(tx)
    }

    s.pendingForcedInclusionTxs = newPendingTxs
    return validatedTxs
}
```

#### Based Sequencer

A new sequencer implementation that ONLY retrieves transactions from DA:

```go
type BasedSequencer struct {
    fiRetriever ForcedInclusionRetriever
    da          coreda.DA
    config      config.Config
    genesis     genesis.Genesis
    logger      zerolog.Logger
    mu          sync.RWMutex
    daHeight    uint64
    txQueue     [][]byte  // Buffer for transactions exceeding batch size
}

func (s *BasedSequencer) GetNextBatch(ctx context.Context, req GetNextBatchRequest) (*GetNextBatchResponse, error) {


    // Always fetch forced inclusion transactions from DA
    forcedEvent, err := s.fiRetriever.RetrieveForcedIncludedTxs(ctx, s.daHeight)
    if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, ErrHeightFromFuture) {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Validate and add transactions to queue
    for _, tx := range forcedEvent.Txs {
        if ValidateBlobSize(tx) {
            s.txQueue = append(s.txQueue, tx)
        }
    }

    // Create batch from queue respecting MaxBytes
    batch := s.createBatchFromQueue(req.MaxBytes)

    return &GetNextBatchResponse{Batch: batch}
}

// SubmitBatchTxs is a no-op for based sequencer
func (s *BasedSequencer) SubmitBatchTxs(ctx context.Context, req SubmitBatchTxsRequest) (*SubmitBatchTxsResponse, error) {
    // Based sequencer ignores submitted transactions
    return &SubmitBatchTxsResponse{}, nil
}
```

#### Syncer Verification

Full nodes verify forced inclusion in the sync process with support for transaction smoothing across multiple blocks and a configurable grace period:

```go
func (s *Syncer) verifyForcedInclusionTxs(currentState State, data *Data) error {
    // 1. Retrieve forced inclusion transactions from DA for current epoch
    forcedEvent, err := s.daRetriever.RetrieveForcedIncludedTxsFromDA(s.ctx, currentState.DAHeight)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // 2. Build map of transactions in current block
    blockTxMap := make(map[string]struct{})
    for _, tx := range data.Txs {
        blockTxMap[hashTx(tx)] = struct{}{}
    }

    // 3. Check if any pending forced inclusion txs from previous epochs are included
    var stillPending []pendingForcedInclusionTx
    s.pendingForcedInclusionTxs.Range(func(key, value any) bool {
        pending := value.(pendingForcedInclusionTx)
        if _, ok := blockTxMap[pending.TxHash]; ok {
            // Transaction was included - remove from pending
            s.pendingForcedInclusionTxs.Delete(key)
        } else {
            stillPending = append(stillPending, pending)
        }
        return true
    })

    // 4. Process new forced inclusion transactions from current epoch
    for _, forcedTx := range forcedEvent.Txs {
        txHash := hashTx(forcedTx)
        if _, ok := blockTxMap[txHash]; !ok {
            // Transaction not included yet - add to pending for deferral within epoch
            stillPending = append(stillPending, pendingForcedInclusionTx{
                Data:       forcedTx,
                EpochStart: forcedEvent.StartDaHeight,
                EpochEnd:   forcedEvent.EndDaHeight,
                TxHash:     txHash,
            })
        }
    }

    // 5. Check for malicious behavior: pending txs past their grace boundary
    // Grace period provides tolerance for temporary chain congestion
    var maliciousTxs, remainingPending []pendingForcedInclusionTx
    for _, pending := range stillPending {
        // Calculate grace boundary: epoch end + (effective grace periods × epoch size)
        effectiveGracePeriod := s.getEffectiveGracePeriod()
        graceBoundary := pending.EpochEnd + (effectiveGracePeriod * s.genesis.DAEpochForcedInclusion)

        // If current DA height is past the grace boundary, these txs MUST have been included
        if currentState.DAHeight > graceBoundary {
            maliciousTxs = append(maliciousTxs, pending)
        } else {
            remainingPending = append(remainingPending, pending)
        }
    }

    // 6. Update pending map with only remaining valid pending txs
    pendingForcedInclusionTxs = remainingPending

    // 7. Reject block if sequencer censored forced txs past grace boundary
    if len(maliciousTxs) > 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("sequencer is malicious: %d forced inclusion transactions past grace boundary not included", len(maliciousTxs))
    }

    return nil
}
```

**Key Verification Features**:

1. **Pending Transaction Tracking**: Maintains a map of forced inclusion transactions that haven't been included yet
2. **Epoch-Based Deferral**: Allows transactions to be deferred (smoothed) across multiple blocks within the same epoch
3. **Strict Epoch Boundary Enforcement**: Once `currentState.DAHeight > pending.EpochEnd`, all pending transactions from that epoch MUST have been included
4. **Censorship Detection**: Identifies malicious sequencers that fail to include forced transactions after epoch boundaries

**Smoothing Example**:

```
Epoch [100-109] contains 3MB of forced inclusion transactions

Block at DA height 100:
  - Includes 2MB of forced txs (partial)
  - Remaining 1MB added to pending map with EpochEnd=109
  - ✅ Valid - within epoch boundary

Block at DA height 105:
  - Includes remaining 1MB from pending
  - Pending map cleared for those txs
  - ✅ Valid - within epoch boundary

Block at DA height 110 (next epoch):
  - If any txs from epoch [100-109] still pending
  - ❌ MALICIOUS - epoch boundary violated
  - Block rejected, sequencer flagged
```

### Implementation Details

#### Epoch-Based Fetching

To avoid excessive DA queries, the DA Retriever uses epoch-based fetching:

- **Epoch Size**: Configurable number of DA blocks (e.g., 10)
- **Epoch Boundaries**: Deterministically calculated based on `DAStartHeight`
- **Fetch Timing**: Only fetch at epoch start to prevent duplicate fetches

```go
// Calculate epoch boundaries
func (r *daRetriever) calculateEpochBoundaries(daHeight uint64) (start, end uint64) {
    epochNum := r.calculateEpochNumber(daHeight)
    start = r.genesis.DAStartHeight + (epochNum-1)*r.daEpochSize
    end = r.genesis.DAStartHeight + epochNum*r.daEpochSize - 1
    return start, end
}

// Only fetch at epoch start
if daHeight != epochStart {
    return &ForcedIncludedEvent{Txs: [][]byte{}}
}

// Fetch all heights in epoch range
for height := epochStart; height <= epochEnd; height++ {
    // Fetch forced inclusion blobs from this DA height
}
```

#### Height From Future Handling

When DA height is not yet available:

```go
if errors.Is(err, coreda.ErrHeightFromFuture) {
    // Keep current DA height, return empty batch
    // Retry same height on next call
    return &ForcedIncludedEvent{Txs: [][]byte{}}, nil
}
```

#### Sequencer Catch-Up Mode

When a single sequencer comes back online after downtime spanning multiple DA epochs, it enters **catch-up mode** to ensure consistency with base sequencing behavior.

**Problem**: If the sequencer was offline for several DA epochs, it missed mempool transactions that were submitted during that time. However, forced inclusion transactions were still being posted to DA and processed by full nodes running in base sequencing mode. When the sequencer restarts, it must produce blocks that match what base sequencing would have produced during the downtime.

**Solution**: The sequencer detects if it has fallen more than one epoch behind the DA head and enters catch-up mode:

1. **Detection**: On the first epoch fetch after startup, query `GetLatestDAHeight()` to determine the gap
2. **Catch-Up Mode**: If more than one epoch behind, enter catch-up mode:
   - Only produce blocks with forced inclusion transactions (no mempool)
   - Use DA epoch end timestamps for block timestamps (to match base sequencing)
3. **Exit**: When `ErrHeightFromFuture` is encountered (reached DA head), exit catch-up mode and resume normal operation

**Key Behaviors During Catch-Up**:

- **No Mempool Transactions**: Only forced inclusion transactions are included in blocks
- **Matching Timestamps**: Block timestamps are derived from DA epoch end times to match base sequencing
- **Checkpoint Persistence**: Progress is tracked via checkpoint to handle crashes during catch-up
- **Single Check**: The `GetLatestDAHeight()` query is performed only once per sequencer lifecycle

**Example**:

Sequencer offline during epochs 100-150 (5 epochs of 10 blocks each)
Full nodes (base sequencing) produced blocks with forced txs only

Sequencer restarts:

1. Checkpoint DA height: 100
2. Latest DA height: 150
3. Missed epochs: 5 (more than 1)
4. Enter catch-up mode

Catch-up process:

- Epoch 101-110: Produce blocks with forced txs only, use epoch timestamps
- Epoch 111-120: Continue catch-up...
- ...
- Epoch 141-150: Still catching up
- Epoch 151: ErrHeightFromFuture -> exit catch-up mode

Normal operation resumes:

- Include both forced txs and mempool txs
- Use current timestamps

**Benefits**:

- Ensures sequencer produces identical blocks to what base sequencing would have produced
- Maintains consistency across the network regardless of sequencer downtime
- Automatic detection and recovery without operator intervention
- Safe restart after crashes (checkpoint tracks progress)

#### Grace Period for Forced Inclusion

The grace period mechanism provides tolerance for chain congestion while maintaining censorship resistance:

**Problem**: If the DA layer experiences temporary unavailability or the chain congestion, the sequencer may be unable to fetch forced inclusion transactions from a completed epoch. Without a grace period, full nodes would immediately flag the sequencer as malicious.

**Solution**: The grace period mechanism allows forced inclusion transactions from epoch N to be included in subsequent epochs before being flagged as malicious. The grace period is dynamically adjusted based on chain fullness.

**Grace Boundary Calculation**:

```go
graceBoundary := epochEnd + (effectiveGracePeriod * DAEpochForcedInclusion)

// Example with base grace period = 1 epoch, DAEpochForcedInclusion = 50:
// - Epoch N ends at DA height 100
// - Grace boundary = 100 + (1 * 50) = 150 (adjusted dynamically by chain fullness)
// - Transaction must be included while currentDAHeight <= graceBoundary
// - If currentDAHeight > graceBoundary without inclusion, sequencer is malicious
```

**Configuration Recommendations**:

- **Production (default)**: Base grace period of 1 epoch
  - Automatically adjusted based on chain fullness
  - Balances censorship resistance with reliability
- **High Security / Reliable DA**: Minimum grace period
  - Stricter enforcement when block space is available
  - Requires 99.9%+ DA uptime
  - Faster detection of censorship
- **Unreliable DA**: Network adjusts grace period dynamically
  - Higher tolerance (up to 3x base period) when chain is congested
  - Reduced censorship resistance temporarily to avoid false positives

**Verification Logic**:

1. Forced inclusion transactions from epoch N are tracked with their epoch boundaries
2. Transactions not immediately included are added to pending queue
3. Each block, full nodes check if pending transactions are past their grace boundary
4. If `currentDAHeight > graceBoundary`, the sequencer is flagged as malicious (strictly greater than)
5. Transactions within the grace period (where `currentDAHeight <= graceBoundary`) remain in pending queue without error

**Benefits**:

- Prevents false positives during temporary DA outages
- Maintains censorship resistance (transactions must be included within grace window)
- Configurable trade-off between reliability and security
- Allows networks to adapt to their DA layer's reliability characteristics

**Examples and Edge Cases**:

Configuration: `DAEpochForcedInclusion = 50`, Base grace period of 1 epoch (dynamically adjusted)

_Example 1: Normal Inclusion (Within Same Epoch)_

```
- Forced tx submitted to DA at height 75 (epoch 51-100)
- Sequencer fetches at height 101 (next epoch start)
- Sequencer includes tx in block at DA height 105
- Result: ✅ Valid - included within same epoch
```

_Example 2: Grace Period Usage (Included in Next Epoch)_

```
- Forced tx submitted to DA at height 75 (epoch 51-100)
- Sequencer fetches at height 101
- DA temporarily unavailable, sequencer cannot fetch
- Sequencer includes tx at DA height 125 (epoch 101-150)
- Grace boundary = 100 + (1 × 50) = 150
- Result: ✅ Valid - within grace period
```

_Example 3: Malicious Sequencer (Past Grace Boundary)_

```
- Forced tx submitted to DA at height 75 (epoch 51-100)
- Sequencer fetches at height 101
- Sequencer deliberately omits tx
- Block produced at DA height 151 (past grace boundary 150)
- Full node detects: currentDAHeight (151) > graceBoundary (150)
- Result: ❌ Block rejected, sequencer flagged as malicious
```

_Example 4: Low Chain Activity (Minimum Grace Period)_

```
- Chain is mostly empty (<20% full)
- Grace period is at minimum (0.5x base period)
- Forced tx submitted at height 75 (epoch 51-100)
- Grace boundary ≈ 100 + (0.5 × 50) = 125
- Stricter enforcement applied when chain is empty
- Result: Faster censorship detection when block space is available
```

_Example 5: Multiple Pending Transactions_

```
- Tx A from epoch ending at height 100, grace boundary 150
- Tx B from epoch ending at height 150, grace boundary 200
- Current DA height: 155
- Tx A not included: ❌ Past grace boundary - malicious
- Tx B not included: ✅ Within grace period - still pending
- Result: Block rejected due to Tx A
```

_Example 6: High Chain Activity (Extended Grace Period)_

```
- Chain is highly congested (>80% full)
- Grace period is extended (up to 3x base period)
- Forced tx submitted at height 75 (epoch 51-100)
- Grace boundary ≈ 100 + (3 × 50) = 250
- Higher tolerance during congestion to avoid false positives
- Result: Better operational reliability when block space is scarce
```

#### Transaction Queue Management

The based sequencer uses a simplified queue to handle transactions:

```go
func (s *BasedSequencer) createBatchFromQueue(maxBytes uint64) *Batch {
    var batch [][]byte
    var totalBytes uint64

    for i, tx := range s.txQueue {
        txSize := uint64(len(tx))
        // Always respect maxBytes, even for first transaction
        if totalBytes+txSize > maxBytes {
            // Would exceed max bytes, keep remaining in queue
            s.txQueue = s.txQueue[i:]
            break
        }

        batch = append(batch, tx)
        totalBytes += txSize

        // Clear queue if we processed everything
        if i == len(s.txQueue)-1 {
            s.txQueue = s.txQueue[:0]
        }
    }

    return &Batch{Transactions: batch}
}
```

**Note**: The based sequencer is simpler than the single sequencer - it doesn't need a separate pending queue because `txQueue` naturally handles all transaction buffering.

### Configuration

### Configuration Examples

#### Traditional Sequencer with Forced Inclusion

```yaml
# genesis.json
{
  "chain_id": "my-rollup",
  "da_epoch_forced_inclusion": 10  # Scan 10 DA blocks at a time
}

# config.toml
[da]
forced_inclusion_namespace = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000666f72636564"

[node]
aggregator = true
based_sequencer = false # Use traditional sequencer
```

#### Based Sequencer (DA-Only)

```yaml
# genesis.json
{
  "chain_id": "my-rollup",
  "da_epoch_forced_inclusion": 5  # Scan 5 DA blocks at a time
}

# config.toml
[da]
forced_inclusion_namespace = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000666f72636564"

[node]
aggregator = true
based_sequencer = true # Use based sequencer
```

### Sequencer Operation Flows

#### Single Sequencer Flow

1. Timer triggers GetNextBatch
2. Fetch forced inclusion txs from DA (via DA Retriever)
   - Only at epoch boundaries
   - Scan epoch range for forced transactions
3. Get batch from mempool queue
4. Prepend forced txs to batch
5. Return batch for block production

#### Based Sequencer Flow

1. Timer triggers GetNextBatch
2. Check transaction queue for buffered txs
3. If queue empty or epoch boundary:
   - Fetch forced inclusion txs from DA
   - Add to queue
4. Create batch from queue (respecting MaxBytes)
5. Return batch for block production

### Full Node Verification Flow

1. Receive block from DA
2. Before applying block:
   a. Fetch forced inclusion txs from DA at block's DA height (epoch-based)
   b. Build map of transactions in block
   c. Check if pending forced txs from previous epochs are included
   d. Add any new forced txs not yet included to pending queue
   e. Calculate grace boundary for each pending tx (dynamically adjusted by chain fullness):
   graceBoundary = epochEnd + (effectiveGracePeriod × DAEpochForcedInclusion)
   f. Check if any pending txs are past their grace boundary
   g. If txs past grace boundary are not included: reject block, flag malicious proposer
   h. If txs within grace period: keep in pending queue, allow block
3. Apply block if verification passes

NOTE: P2P nodes do not perform forced inclusion verification. This is because DA inclusion happens after block production, and DA hints are added later to broadcasted blocks.

**Grace Period Example** (with base grace period = 1 epoch, `DAEpochForcedInclusion = 50`):

- Forced tx appears in epoch ending at DA height 100
- Grace boundary = 100 + (1 × 50) = 150
- Transaction can be included at any DA height from 101 to 150
- When currentDAHeight > 150 without inclusion, sequencer is flagged as malicious

### Efficiency Considerations

1. **Epoch-Based Fetching**: Reduces DA queries by batching multiple DA heights
2. **Deterministic Epochs**: All nodes calculate same epoch boundaries
3. **Fetch at Epoch Start**: Prevents duplicate fetches as DA height progresses
4. **Transaction Queue**: Buffers excess transactions across multiple blocks
5. **Conditional Fetching**: Only when forced inclusion namespace is configured
6. **Size Pre-validation**: Invalid blobs rejected early, before batch construction
7. **Efficient Queue Operations**:
   - Single sequencer: `Prepend()` reuses space before head position
   - Based sequencer: Simple slice operations for queue management

**DA Query Frequency**:

Every `DAEpochForcedInclusion` DA blocks

**Attack Vectors**:

### Security Considerations

- **Censorship**: Mitigated by forced inclusion verification with grace period
  - Transactions must be included within grace window (epoch + grace period)
  - Full nodes detect and reject blocks from malicious sequencers
  - Grace period = 0 provides immediate detection but requires high DA reliability
  - Grace period = 1+ balances censorship resistance with operational tolerance
- **DA Spam**: Limited by DA layer's native spam protection and two-tier blob size limits
- **Block Withholding**: Full nodes can fetch and verify from DA independently
- **Oversized Batches**: Prevented by strict size validation at multiple levels
- **Grace Period Attacks**:
  - Malicious sequencer cannot indefinitely delay forced transactions
  - Grace boundary is deterministic and enforced by all full nodes
  - Longer grace periods extend time to detect censorship (trade-off)

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Censorship Resistance**: Users have guaranteed path to include transactions
2. **Verifiable**: Full nodes enforce forced inclusion, detecting malicious sequencers
3. **Simple Design**: No complex timing mechanisms or fallback modes
4. **Based Rollup Option**: Fully DA-driven transaction ordering available (simplified implementation)
5. **Optional**: Forced inclusion can be disabled for permissioned deployments
6. **Efficient**: Epoch-based fetching minimizes DA queries
7. **Flexible**: Configurable epoch size and grace period allow tuning latency vs reliability
8. **Robust Size Handling**: Two-tier size validation prevents DoS and DA rejections
9. **Transaction Preservation**: All valid transactions are preserved in queues, nothing is lost
10. **Strict MaxBytes Compliance**: Batches never exceed limits, preventing DA submission failures
11. **DA Fault Tolerance**: Grace period prevents false positives during temporary chain congestion
12. **Automatic Recovery**: Sequencer catch-up mode ensures consistency after downtime without operator intervention

### Negative

1. **Increased Latency**: Forced transactions subject to epoch boundaries
2. **DA Dependency**: Requires DA layer to be enabled on nodes for verification
3. **Higher DA Costs**: Users pay DA posting fees for forced inclusion
4. **Epoch Configuration**: Requires setting `DAEpochForcedInclusion` in genesis (consensus parameter)

### Neutral

1. **Two Sequencer Types**: Choice between single (hybrid) and based (DA-only)
2. **Privacy Model Unchanged**: Forced inclusion has same privacy as normal path
3. **Monitoring**: Operators should monitor forced inclusion namespace usage and grace period metrics
4. **Documentation**: Users need guidance on when to use forced inclusion and grace period implications
5. **Genesis Parameters**: `DAEpochForcedInclusion` is a consensus parameter fixed at genesis; grace period adjustment is dynamic
